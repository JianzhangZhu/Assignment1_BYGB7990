Hello! Welcome to the ReadMe Instruction of the Python Programm of Jianzhang Zhu. In this file, I will explain all the codes to you! This program is a three currencies calculator system, which can automatically exchange each specific amount of one of the three kinds of currency, USD, EUR and RMB, into another kind of currency.

In the first row, there is a comment, not a code, that tells us this is Jianzhang Zhu Assignment 1.

At the 3-5 rows, I set up three unique values to three variables, called exchange rates. In this part, varibale EU_exchange_rate, equals to 1.02, represents the exchange rate of EUR and USD, variable ER_exchange_rate, equals to 6.97, represents the exchange rate of EUR and RMB and variable UR_exchange_rate, equals to 7.11, represents the exchange rate of USD and RMB.

Then, the next code is a welcome message to all the system users.

Next, the code is designed for asking user about the exact amount of currency they want to exchange.

After this, the designed code in the next row will ask user about the exact kind of currency they have, and then set the result as the value of variable Currency_Type.

Then, the designed code in the next row will ask user about the exact kind of currency they want to exchange to, and then set the result as the value of variable Objective_Type.

After confirming both the Currency_Type and Objective_Type, moving forward to the further codes, there are the codes that check the certain condition, the Currency_Type and Objective_Type. Under different conditions, which are cetain the combos of Currency_Type and Objective_Type, the system will calculate a cretain outcome by using certain corresponding exchange rate and the certain amount that user has inputed. Moreover, once users input some wrong commands, such as other type of currencies that are not included in this calculation system or wrong typing, the system will show a instruct message to inform the user.

Ultimately, in the last row of this python program, there is the code that outputs the outcomes to the users, telling users the precise result of exchanging currencies.

Thank you for reading and hope this instruction could help you.
